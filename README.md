# A Tour of Selected Cryptography up until Accumulators

This is the result of a project for an applied cryptography class in Winter
2020. I thought it might be generally useful, so I decided to put it up on
GitHub.

The article itself is in [tour.md](tour.md), but the individual files are commented
thoroughly so if you really only care about one thing you can go straight to
it.

If you think it's cool, I encourage you to enroll in a cryptography class
somewhere local to you. There's also a freely available draft of a textbook
online at http://toc.cryptobook.us. Attending class is certainly a value add
over self study, no matter how excellent the textbook is.

Any code here is for learning purposes only and is not to be used in any real
situation that needs cryptography.
